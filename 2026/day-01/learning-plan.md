    I am starting my DevOps Journey to move forward in career beyond development and integration and build long term career relevance.

    Now, I want to strengthen my understanding and skills of infrastructure, automation, and operations to grow into a DevOps and Cloud Roles.

    Currently I am wokring as a developer with hands-on experience in Integrating Business Application, APIs, CI/CD, and Cloud, I have worked with real production systems.

- Where do you want to reach?
    My aim is to be ready for DevOps and Cloud Roles.
    I aim to have strong Foundational confidence and be capable of applying these skills in real scenarios.

    I want to be able to:
    - Clearly explain core DevOps and cloud concepts
    - Work comfortably with Linux, Git, and networking basics
    - Build and manage CI/CD pipelines
    - Containerize applications using Docker
    - Understand Kubernetes fundamentals and its role in production
    - Deploy applications on cloud platforms
    - Monitor applications using logs, metrics, and alerts
    - Confidently discuss DevOps workflows in interviews and technical discussions

- How you will stay consistent every single day?
    The very first thing, I will treat this as a priority commitment.
    I will stay Consistent and Displine to do this.
    I will study everyday for 2 hours.
    Even on busy days, I will read, revise and practice.
    I will focus on Learning + Hands-on

## Why This Matters for DevOps
DevOps engineers succeed not just because of tools, but because of:

- Discipline
- Ownership
- Long-term thinking

This task trains you to **take ownership of your own growth**, just like a real DevOps engineer.

A clear plan:

- Prevents burnout
- Keeps you focused during tough days
