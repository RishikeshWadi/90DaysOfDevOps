## Task
Today’s goal is to **set the foundation for your DevOps journey**.

You will create a **90-day personal DevOps learning plan** that clearly defines:

---

### 1. What is your understanding of DevOps and Cloud Engineering?

DevOps is not just a set of tools, it’s a **Culture and Mindset** that connects development and operations teams to deliver software applications faster, reliably, by reducing time to market, automating repetitive tasks, and scaling to end users.

Cloud Engineering is like the **backbone of DevOps** to make it scalable and efficient. Cloud allows teams to move faster, scale easily, and reduce infrastructure overheads.

**To explain in simple terms:**
- **DevOps:** Speed, Collaboration, Automation, Reliability  
- **Cloud:** Scalability, Flexibility, Efficiency

---

### 2. Why you are starting learning DevOps & Cloud?

I am starting my DevOps journey to **move forward in my career** beyond development and integration and build **long-term career relevance**.

Now, I want to **strengthen my understanding and skills of infrastructure, automation, and operations** to grow into DevOps and Cloud roles.

Currently, I am working as a **developer** with hands-on experience in Integrating business applications, APIs, CI/CD, Cloud. I have worked with **real production systems**.

---

### 3. Where do you want to reach?

My aim is to be ready for **DevOps and Cloud roles**.  
I aim to have **strong foundational confidence** and be capable of applying these skills in real scenarios.

I want to be able to:
- Clearly explain core DevOps and Cloud concepts  
- Work comfortably with Linux, Git, and networking basics  
- Build and manage CI/CD pipelines  
- Containerize applications using Docker  
- Understand Kubernetes fundamentals and its role in production  
- Deploy applications on cloud platforms  
- Monitor applications using logs, metrics, and alerts  
- Confidently discuss DevOps workflows in interviews and technical discussions  

---

### 4. How you will stay consistent every single day?

The very first thing, I will treat this as a **priority commitment**.

I will:
- Stay consistent and disciplined to do this  
- Study **everyday for 2 hours**  
- Even on busy days, read, revise, and practice  
- Focus on **Learning + Hands-on**  
- Maintain a **daily learning log** to track progress

## Why This Matters for DevOps

DevOps engineers succeed not just because of tools, but because of:
- Discipline  
- Ownership  
- Long-term thinking  
- Ability to execute consistently  

In real jobs, **no one tells you exactly what to do every day**.  
This task trains you to **take ownership of your own growth**, just like a real DevOps engineer.

A clear plan:
- Reduces confusion  
- Prevents burnout  
- Keeps you focused during tough days

**Happy Learning!**
